# grille.css

Just a basic template for a simple grid system. You can use it wherever you want.

## Use

This is an exemple of the structure you need to use :

```
<div class="grid grid2">
	<div>Your content</div>
	<div>Your content</div>
</div>
```

Your columns will be generated with the first children of the element that has the ```.grid``` class.

You can configurate the grid using an other class.

For example : 
* ```.grid2``` 
* ```.grid3```
* ```.grid1-2```
* ```.grid2-1```
