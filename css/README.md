# debug.css

This file is all commented in French to remain easily understandable in my work team.

## Use

Copy/paste the code in your main CSS file or create a new one to use it. It will show you some errors caused by tools we use in our everyday work such as broken links or style configuration inside your HTML.

Errors are shown in red and warnings in orange.

Be sure to **remove** this debug when you push your project in production !
