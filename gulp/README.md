# How to use ?

## Gulp Installation

Firstly, you have to install [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

Then, in your terminal run the following command to globally install Gulp on your computer :

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

## Tool installation

### Download & install

Download all the files from the tool you want and paste them inside a new folder (I recommend you to name it like I did in this repository) on your computer. 

In each of these tools, you will find a filled ```package.json``` that contains all the needed dependencies of the tool. So the only thing left to do is to run :

```
$ npm install
```

It will automatically install the dependencies in your project.

### Very simple use

Now you just have to run the ```gulp``` command in your folder to launch the tool. Check each tool's documentation for more informations. ;)
